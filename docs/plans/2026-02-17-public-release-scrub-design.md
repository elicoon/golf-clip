# Golf-Clip Public Release Scrub Design

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Goal:** Prepare the golf-clip repo for public visibility on GitHub as a portfolio/reference project.

## Context

Golf-clip is a monorepo containing:
- **Active:** `apps/browser/` — React + Vite web app, deployed on Vercel
- **Active:** `apps/desktop/` — Tauri + Python FastAPI desktop app, reached a good state
- **Paused/excluded:** `apps/webapp/` — cloud webapp with PostgreSQL backend
- **Paused/excluded:** `packages/` — shared code extracted during monorepo refactor

The repo is currently private. Audience for public release is portfolio/reference (not seeking contributors).

## Branch & Safety Strategy

1. Create git tag `pre-public-archive` on current `main` — permanent bookmark to full private state
2. Create branch `public-release` off `main` — all cleanup happens here
3. Review full diff on `public-release` before merging to `main`
4. Merge `public-release` → `main`, then flip repo to public on GitHub

**Note:** Git history becomes public once the repo is public. The webapp and all other historical code will be visible in commit history — this is acceptable. The tag provides a convenient reference to the pre-cleanup state.

## What Gets Removed from the Tree

| Path | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `apps/webapp/` | Not active, not being showcased |
| `packages/` | Paused shared code, not relevant to showcase |
| `.claude/` (root) | Internal Claude Code config directory |
| `CLAUDE.md` (root) | Claude-specific developer instructions |
| `backlog/` (root) | Internal task tracker |
| `apps/browser/backlog/` | Internal task tracker for browser app |
| `PARALLEL_TASKS.md` | Internal parallel task planning artifact |
| `phase_2_plan.md` | Internal phase planning artifact |
| `docs/archive/` | Session handoffs, bug reports, internal artifacts |
| `docs/plans/` | Feature design docs generated by internal tooling |

## What Stays

| Path | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `apps/browser/` | Active web app — primary showcase |
| `apps/desktop/` | Desktop app — reached good state, worth showcasing |
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | Technical design — portfolio value |
| `docs/FEATURES.md` | Feature documentation — portfolio value |
| `docs/API.md` | API reference — portfolio value |
| `docs/PRODUCT-WALKTHROUGH.md` | User flow guide — portfolio value |
| `README.md` | Already polished for public GitHub |
| `LICENSE` | MIT license |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contributing guide |
| `PRD.md` | Product requirements — shows product thinking |
| `vercel.json`, `.vercelignore`, `.dockerignore` | Deployment config |
| `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, root config | Workspace config |

## Commit History

Leave as-is. Commit messages referencing internal tooling (backlog management, product-strategist agent, debug commits, stash artifacts) are acceptable for a portfolio repo and tell an authentic story of the development process.

## Secrets & Credentials

- `.env` files are already gitignored and not committed — no action needed
- Supabase anon key (`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) is a publishable key by design — acceptable to be visible in build output/config
- `.vercel/` directories are already gitignored — no action needed

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `pre-public-archive` tag exists on `main`
- [ ] `public-release` branch created and all listed paths removed
- [ ] Diff reviewed — no sensitive files, no internal artifacts
- [ ] `public-release` merged to `main`
- [ ] GitHub repo visibility flipped to public
- [ ] Repo landing page (README) renders correctly and represents the project well
