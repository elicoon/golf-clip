### Video zoom and pan controls for clip review
- **Project:** golf-clip
- **Status:** not started
- **Priority:** high
- **Type:** feature
- **Scope:** medium
- **Dispatch effort:** 1 hr
- **Planned completion:** none
- **Blockers:** none
- **Notes:** Previously documented in FEATURES.md as if implemented, but zoom/pan was never built. Needed for precise marker placement on landing/origin points, especially on high-res video. Should include keyboard shortcuts (+/-/0) and mouse-based pan when zoomed.
- **Added:** 2026-02-16
- **Updated:** 2026-02-16

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] +/- keyboard shortcuts zoom video 1x-4x in 0.5x increments
- [ ] 0 key resets zoom to 1x
- [ ] Click-and-drag pans when zoomed in (cursor changes to grab)
- [ ] All marking functionality (landing, origin) works at any zoom level
- [ ] Zoom state resets when navigating to next shot
