### Update 3 Stale CI/DX Backlog Items to Reflect Completed Work
- **Project:** golf-clip
- **Status:** not started
- **Priority:** medium
- **Type:** grooming
- **Scope:** small
- **Planned completion:** none
- **Blockers:** none
- **Notes:** Three backlog items are marked "not started" but have completed work: (1) `ci-add-pre-commit-hooks-husky-lint-staged.md` — done, commits 7e17c13 and 41c7cd0 on feat/pre-commit-hooks branch, PR #27 open. (2) `refactor-add-prettier-formatting-with-ci-check.md` — done, commit 4c7a390, PR #25 open. (3) `test-add-accessibility-checks-to-e2e-suite.md` — done, commits f6613f6 and 2a159fe on current branch. Stale statuses mislead the handler and strategist about available work.
